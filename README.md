# MyMVVMCoroutinesDaggerApp

This project is created to showcase the architecture and dependency injection, and contains minimal UI elements as it is not the main focus of this project.
This app displays a list of products. 
MVVM architecture is used to structure this project. To make the api call we're using retrofit and coroutines. With the help of dispatchers
we make the call asyncronously. Dagger 2 is used for dependency injection.
